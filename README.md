# Shopping Marathon @ Shararam - Bot

My childhood game about Smeshariki. I thought I'd check it out and get some nostalgia. They made a new game based on the old one, where you have to collect healthy food and bypass barriers. Played so for about 10 minutes and decided to make a bot for it. Never made them this way, through screenshots of the game, so I'm trying it here. Although, I believe it is possible to do it through server response spoofing, spoofing game files or something.

The code is not yet complete. The recognition of barriers and the food itself needs to be improved. In plans add different games from the game.
